## 🚀 The Problem

Finding the right talent is hard, and applying to jobs feels like a guessing game. Employers spend countless hours reviewing resumes that don't match their needs, while talented professionals get lost in the noise of job applications. Traditional job platforms are essentially digital bulletin boards - they show you the jobs, but give you no insight into whether you're actually a good fit, or help you find the opportunities where you would truly excel.

The current system treats job hunting as a numbers game rather than a strategic matching process, leading to frustration, missed opportunities, and hiring inefficiencies that cost everyone time and money.

## ✨ Our Solution

**Kormo Connect** - suitability Platform, revolutionizes the job market by using **Google Gemini AI** to create intelligent, two-way matching between professionals and employers. Our platform doesn't just list jobs - it analyzes, scores, and provides actionable insights that make every connection meaningful.

**What makes us different:**
- **AI-Powered Suitability Analysis**: Every professional gets instant AI-generated compatibility scores, strengths, and improvement areas for any job
- **Intelligent Job Discovery**: Our "Find Best Matches" feature uses AI to analyze your profile and automatically surface the perfect opportunities
- **Smart Profile Building**: Upload your CV once, and our AI fills out your entire profile automatically
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Employers can rate professionals, creating a transparent quality system that benefits everyone
